England Clinch Dramatic Ashes Series Level at The Oval

In a fitting conclusion to a captivating summer, England secured victory in the fifth Test at The Oval to level the Ashes series 2-2. The result means England retain their honour despite Australia's claim on the urn, having drawn the series after being 2-0 down.

Stuart Broad's Emotional Farewell

Perhaps the most poignant moment came when Stuart Broad announced his retirement from international cricket. In his 167th and final Test match, Broad took the final wicket to seal England's win - a fairytale ending for a man who has claimed 604 wickets in Test cricket. The Oval crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked off the field for the last time.

Root and Woakes Partnership Seals the Deal

The match turned decisively when Joe Root and Chris Woakes came together with England still requiring 155 runs to win. Root, playing with the composure that has defined his career, scored 91 before falling agonisingly short of a century. Woakes contributed 78, and their partnership of 155 runs proved to be the decisive blow. Root was later named Player of the Match for his contributions with both bat and ball.

Moeen Ali's Crucial Contribution

Moeen Ali's off-spin proved vital in England's bowling attack, claiming figures of 3-48 in Australia's second innings. His ability to extract turn and bounce from the worn pitch troubled the Australian batsmen throughout the final day.

Crawley's Breakout Series

Zak Crawley was named Man of the Series following a remarkable summer with the bat. His century at Old Trafford was the highlight, as the young opener showed he belongs at the highest level. His aggressive approach perfectly suited England's 'Bazball' philosophy.
