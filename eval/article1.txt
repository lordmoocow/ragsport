Fulham Edge Past Nottingham Forest in Tight Encounter

Fulham secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Nottingham Forest at Craven Cottage, extending their impressive run to six wins in their last seven Premier League meetings with the East Midlands side.

The Decisive Moment: Jimenez's Penalty

The only goal came from the penalty spot, with Raul Jimenez keeping his nerve to convert. The Mexican striker has now scored 11 out of 11 penalties in English football, matching Yaya Toure's remarkable conversion rate. John Victor was adjudged to have fouled the forward in the box, giving Jimenez the opportunity to settle the contest from the spot-kick.

Kevin's Impressive Display

The Brazilian winger Kevin, Fulham's 34.6m summer signing, was the standout performer. His trickery down the left flank caused Forest constant problems, and he was unlucky not to add to the scoresheet before being substituted after 78 minutes. Brazil assistant manager Paul Clement was watching from the stands, reportedly monitoring the 23-year-old ahead of upcoming international fixtures.

Missing Players: AFCON Duty Calls

Fulham were without several key players due to Afcon qualifiers. Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey were both representing Nigeria, while loan player Chukwueze was also away with his national team. Despite these absences, Marco Silva's side showed their squad depth.

Forest's Attacking Woes

Nottingham Forest struggled to create meaningful chances throughout the match. Manager Sean Dyche will be concerned by his team's attacking output - they managed just 0.60 expected goals and registered few shots on target. Their best opportunities came in the second half when Neco Williams found space down the right, setting up Morgan Gibbs-White whose effort was blocked. Defender Murillo also went close with a header from a corner, but overall Forest lacked the cutting edge to trouble Bernd Leno in the Fulham goal.

Fulham's Defensive Solidity

It was a professional performance from Fulham, who controlled possession and rarely looked troubled at the back. This victory moves them into the top half of the table, while Forest's winless run extends to four matches.
